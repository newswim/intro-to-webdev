This week we will be learning the building blocks of making basic web pages: HTML and CSS. We will also focus on using the command line and Git to create a daily workflow for our coding projects.

###Plan
We will begin this week by practicing the command line, Git, Github, and exploring basic HTML. We'll create READMEs to include extra information with our projects on Github. We'll also learn a formatting language called Markdown to format READMEs. Then, we'll explore basic CSS to add styling to our web pages, and actually publish our sites online! Later in the week we will dive deeper into CSS by using divs and spans, floats, cascading, classes, ids, and the box model. Finally, we'll explore a tool called Bootstrap that offers even more powerful styling capability.

At the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Navigate the command line to access and create directories and files
* Use Git and GitHub to track the creation of static webpages
* Create a static webpage using HTML
* Style a static webpage using custom CSS rules in a linked stylesheet
* Create a project README.md in Markdown
* Apply Bootstrap rules and classes
* Adapt a webpage for responsive design
